### I`m a beginner backend developer

### About Me:
For a long time I was just writing small projects in Python, trying to find something interesting. Now I have chosen backend development as my focus.
- :receipt: I'm currently using Django/Drango Rest as my primary framework, but I plan to switch to another framework or even language this summer.
- :biohazard: During my search for something interesting to do, I tried writing code in C#, Kotlin, and JavaScript, so I have a decent understanding of the basics of these languages.
- :atom: For a while I considered fully transitioning into embedded development and working with Arduino and Raspberry, but in the end I decided against that idea.
