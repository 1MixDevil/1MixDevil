### I`m a backend developer

### About Me:
For a long time I was just writing small projects in Python, trying to find something interesting. Now I have chosen backend development as my focus.
For a long time, I was just writing small projects in Python, trying to find something interesting. Now I've chosen backend development as my focus.
- :receipt: Over a year of commercial development experience with Django REST Framework/FastAPI
- :biohazard: Searching for interesting projects, actively learning Go
- :atom: For a while, I considered fully transitioning to embedded development and working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but ultimately abandoned the idea, settling for a basic understanding of these technologies. I like to think of it as a fun side project!
- :seedling: Always learning.
- :rocket: Looking for opportunities to build scalable and reliable backend systems.
- :computer: Passionate about clean code and efficient architecture.
